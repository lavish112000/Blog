## 💬 Review Comments Guidelines

### ✅ Good Comment Examples:
- **Suggestion**: "Consider using a Map instead of an object here for better performance with large datasets"
- **Praise**: "Great use of error boundaries here! This will improve user experience significantly"
- **Question**: "Could you explain the reasoning behind this approach? I'm wondering if there's a simpler way"
- **Security**: "This input should be sanitized to prevent XSS attacks"

### ❌ Avoid These:
- "This is wrong" (not constructive)
- "I don't like this" (personal preference without justification)
- "Fix this" (not specific enough)

### 🎯 Focus Areas:
1. **Correctness**: Does it work?
2. **Clarity**: Is it understandable?
3. **Consistency**: Does it fit the codebase?
4. **Security**: Is it safe?
5. **Performance**: Is it efficient?
